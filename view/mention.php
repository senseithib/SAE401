            <h2>Special circumstances as to particular award conditions (updated February 7, 2025):</h2>
            <p>
                Whenever (in certain special circumstances) the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") determines a legal notice regarding Office of Justice Programs (“OJP”) award requirements to be necessary or determines that it will not implement or enforce (in whole or in part) one or more requirements otherwise applicable to an OJP award, it is OJP's general practice to set out notice of each such determination through this "Legal Notices" webpage. Any legal notice pertaining to award requirements that is posted through this webpage is incorporated by reference into the award.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>N.B.:</strong> Award requirements include not only award conditions, but also compliance with assurances and certifications that relate to conduct during the period of performance for the award.

                The “Authorization to obligate (federal) award funds to reimburse certain project costs . . . ” award condition on BJA’s FY 2024 JAG awards includes a clerical error that erroneously (but immaterially) points to October 1, 2022 as the first day of the period of performance for the awards. The correct start of the period of performance for BJA’s FY 2024 JAG awards is October 1, 2023. Recipients are to disregard the erroneous fiscal year references to “2022” in this condition.

                Pursuant to a permanent injunction issued by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, as of August 22, 2024, DOJ will not implement or enforce the disparate impact requirements under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 placed on awards that were previously made or offered or are made or offered, in FY 2024 or thereafter, in the State of Louisiana.

            <p>
                <strong>NOTICE</strong><br>
                The “Applicability of Part 200 Uniform Requirements” award condition on OJP’s FY 2023 awards includes a clerical error that erroneously (but immaterially) describes the FY 2023 award as a FY 2022 award. The fiscal year of the award is indicated by the agency approval signature date set forth in the Award Information in the Federal Award Instrument. Recipients are to disregard the erroneous fiscal year references to “2022” in this condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “Compliance with general appropriations-law restrictions on the use of federal funds” condition on OJP’s FY 2023 awards includes a clerical error that erroneously refers in the title to FY 2022, and erroneously links to the OJP webpages describing restrictions pertinent to FY 2022. The fiscal year of the award is indicated by the agency approval signature date set forth in the Award information in the Federal Award instrument. Recipients are to disregard the erroneous fiscal year references to “2022” in this condition, and refer to the pertinent FY 2023 restrictions, including from various “general provisions” in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which are set out at <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/award-condition-general-appropriations-law-restrictions-use-federal-award-funds-fy-2023" target="_blank">this link</a>.
